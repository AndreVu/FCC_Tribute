        <h3>✝ Facts about Jesus ✝</h3>
        <p id="headline" class="description">
          Jesus was born about 2,000 years ago in the land of Israel and became
          a religious figure known throughout the world. He is the founder of
          Christianity.
          <br />
          <br />
          Below is a list of items that help explain who Jesus is:
        </p>

        <hr />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Christians believe that Jesus is the Christ, or Messiah, who was
            promised by the prophets of the Old Testament of the Bible.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Old Testament was written centuries before the birth of Jesus.
            It spoke of the sinful nature of people and how sin separates people
            from God. It contains dozens of promises from God (prophecies) that
            he would send a Messiah - a special being anointed by God - who
            would restore people to God.
          </li>
          <li>
            The prophecies include details about the reason for a Messiah, his
            nature, his family lineage, birthplace and timing of his birth, the
            purpose of his life, as well as details about his death and
            resurrection.
          </li>
          <li>
            Throughout history, Jesus is the only person widely regarded to be
            the Messiah who was promised by the Old Testament.
          </li>
          <li>
            Jesus' followers wrote the New Testament of the Bible, during the
            decades that followed his death and resurrection. The New Testament
            was completed about 1900 years ago.
          </li>
          <li>
            Jesus was born about 2000 years ago in the town of Bethlehem, which
            is near Jerusalem in the land of Israel.
          </li>
          <li>
            The New Testament describes the birth of Jesus as being miraculous,
            that he was born of a virgin.
          </li>
          <li>
            Christians believe that Jesus is God incarnate as a man, that he is
            both fully human and fully God.
          </li>
          <li>
            Jesus grew up in the town of Nazareth, in the northern part of
            Israel. That is why he also is known as "Jesus of Nazareth."
          </li>
          <li>
            Jesus was about 30-years old when he started his public ministry,
            preaching and performing miracles.
          </li>
          <li>
            He preached a message of forgiveness and salvation. The New
            Testament has 27 parts - referred to as "books" - and these include
            the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, which contain many
            details about Jesus' public ministry.
          </li>
          <li>
            Jesus performed about 30 miracles that are recorded in the New
            Testment. The miracles include healing people of blindness, deafness
            and other ailments, overcoming nature, and raising two people from
            the dead.
          </li>
          <li>
            His public ministry lasted about 3.5 years until he was executed.
          </li>
          <li>
            He was executed by the Romans after being falsely accused of being a
            rebel. The land of Israel was part of the Roman Empire during the
            time of Jesus.
          </li>
          <li>
            Jesus was arrested, beaten and executed by crucifixion. The Romans
            often used crucifixion as a means of publicly executing people.
          </li>
          <li>
            Jesus' followers wrote that Jesus died and was buried and then rose
            again to life three days later. This is called the resurrection.
          </li>
          <li>
            After his resurrection, he met with his followers, preached for a
            short time more and then ascended into Heaven.
          </li>
          <li>
            The New Testament says that Jesus will return in the future to judge
            the living and the dead. That event is typically called Judgment
            Day.
          </li>
          <li>
            The New Testament does not say when Jesus is to return. But it does
            say that when he does, it will be obvious and known to everyone in
            the world.
          </li>
          <li>
            Anyone with faith in Jesus is forgiven of all sin, regardless of
            what they have done. In Christianity, faith in Jesus equals
            forgiveness and salvation.
          </li>
          <li>
            The New Testament also says that Jesus is the only means of
            salvation, that he alone is the intercessor between people and God
            the Father.
          </li>
        </ul>
